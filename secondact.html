        <h5 class="POOR">POOR MAN</h5> 
        <p class="speech">You see, your honor, I've been poor all my life. I've never
had much fun. I don't ask for a lot of money, but--I would like enough
so that I could have some swell clothes, and--so that I could eat,
drink, and be merry with the boys. You know, I just want to have a good
time. Do you think you could fix it for me, Judge?</p>

<h5 class="JUDGE">JUDGE</h5>
<p class="direction">[Gazes at him sternly for a moment.]</p>
<p class="speech">So you just want to have a good time? Want me to take away your poverty? I suppose you have no
moral weakness you want to change, no defects in your character that you
want to better?</p>

<h5 class="POOR">POOR MAN</h5>
<p class="direction">[Stammering and twirling his hat.]</p>
<p class="speech">Why, w-hy, Judge, I--I amnot a bad man. Of--of course, I have my faults, but then--I've never
committed any crimes. I guess I stack up pretty fair as men go. I'm just
awful tired of being poor and never having any fun. Couldn't you help me
out on that point, Judge?</p>
